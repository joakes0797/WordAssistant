# WordAssistant
A program to track your Wordle wins utilizing CRUD operations.

The first part of this app takes the green, yellow, and gray letters from your daily Wordle attempt and narrows down the list of 2309 answers to something a bit more manageable.

The second part of the app then lets you store your answer, the outcome of your game, and the date in a database.

I wrote a stripped-down version of this app, called "WordAssistantSlim":  https://github.com/joakes0797/WordAssistantSlim

And that app is hosted here:  https://wordleassistant.azurewebsites.net/
